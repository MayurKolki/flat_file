hello sir i am aspiring data scientist
developing myself in all terms.
its grateful to be connected with u.
also purshing the DL With Computer Vision & Advanced NLP @ineuron
i have been following your vedios from last 8+ months 
it has  been great help ..

Gradient Descent :-to find the optimun values for a,b
                    a,b are coefficients in LIN_REG/LOG_REG

######################################## 18 april
deep learning application :-
* what is diference bet AL vs ML vs DL vs DS vs NLP_Engineer

AI:- in entire universe in field of AI ,at the end of the you will be creating AI APPLICATION ,ex-netfix,selfdriving car, amazon.in,youtube
netflix has recommder systme which is app , which works on user 

that AI application will work withour human intervention 

ML- is subset of AI ,becoz the most and imp thing is data, ml provids you stats tool to analyze the data, prediction,forecasting
 main aim is prediction ,classification, forecasting

different types of ML:- supervise un unsupervised

supervised data has labelled data ,we know end goal 
2 diferent techniques  --- reg and classification
reg-- output will be continuous value 
classification -- output will be fixed number of categories
binary
multiclass
multilabel :-
movie            action  romance  thrill  suspense
endgame           1       0          1         1
drishyam          0       0          1         1


unsupervised ML:- we dont know your output,, main task, is clustering, segmentation, reducing dimension

product --->  costly product 
customer      salary  spending score(0-9)
              65000        3
              30000        5
              90000        4
              10000        9

we will send mail with one with high spending score, but we make cluster such that  30k-60k with score(3-5), like these types




semi-supervised machine learning (reenforecment):- 
labelled  data --> Model  --> Recommendation 
interaction  --> Model learns -->New Recommendation




DL :-basically a subset of ML 
DL is mostly talking about neural networks
scientist thought we human being research how our brain workes
most powerful living being with respect to thinking
 **main aim of DL was to mimic the human brain  
ex-alpha go, cheese   
 it exactly means  make machine learn how we human being learn

DL:- techniques initially starting with ANN ,
  #ANN is basically called as Artificatial neural network <-- works on all tabular kind of data.
    have u eared of automated machine learning, there you will see that ,
any automated machine learning when we are  taking any kind of tabular data ,
they will try to verify with all the ML algorithm and they will also verify it with ANN
# so all the tast that you can do it with ML can also done by ANN


CNN<-- convolution Neural n/w <-- input data as Images ,Vedios
applications of CNN
     1)  Image classification   <--CNN, transfer learning
     2)  Object Detection    <--RCNN, FAST RCNN, FASTER RCNN, SSD, YOLO version V1,V2,V3,V5 ,DETECTRON
     3)  Segmentation   <-- HEAVYLY USED IN SELF DRIVING CARS
     4) tracking
     5) face recognation
     6) GAN

RNN<-- Recurrent Neural Network <-- input is Text,Timeseries, sequencial Data
    1) RNN
    2)LSTM RNN  (GR user)
    3)Bidirectional LSTM RNN
    4)Encoder Decoder
    5)Transformers
    6)BERT
    7)GPT1,GPT2,GPT3

NLP data:- data is "text" data
we have convert text data into an numerical representation, that representation is called as "Vectors"
while coverting in numerical vectors there are various technique
1)Bag of words
2)TFIDF
3)Word2vec  (library called janasems)
4)Embedding

unigram,bigram,mgram all are part of this kind of text processing, we also cover "rasa", whewre we will show you how to create chatbot
