i)  Case study on Corona 
                 Project Description : study the novel corona virus analysis
    “ https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/ “  this website helped to get the revisied data ,
From which we where  able to draw graphs , plot the areas wise spread and recovery death rate , Pretty good insight /patterns where brought .
 Monthly , weekly , data with respect to region wise graph where plot.
  Growth rate was exponential  y=me^kx  and not the linear   y=mx+c
   Rate of change = np.log(week2/week1)
We did the analysis based on the rate of change weekly



  project to share in  resume 
 why we should use "softmax" whule building output layer pn NEURAL network in multiclass classification?

  understanding the business problems 

 in multiclass train test all the unqiue types shold be present in train data , so that model learn from the info whch it will obtain from data

as tvalue increases, p area decreases
that is why we say area less than 0.05 is significant , 
the value greater than 1.645 is significant

What is hexadecimal used for?
Hexadecimal (or hex) is a base 16 system used to simplify how binary is represented. 
A hex digit can be any of the following 16 digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F.
 Each hex digit reflects a 4-bit binary sequence. 
This table shows each hex digit with the equivalent values in binary and denary.

             --------OOP--------
In this class, we discuss class and object with an example in python.
Class is a blueprint of an object.
An object is an instance of a class.
We take an analogy to understand class and object.
We will have a house blueprint on a chart.
we construct a house in India, the USA, and Japan.
The house that is given space in this world and constructed is an object.
The same blueprint different houses. each is an object for the same class.


In this class, we discuss constructor, instance variable, and self in python.
A constructor is a special method that is called by a python interpreter during the time of object creation.
__init__ is the constructor method.
This method will take the first variable as the self.
Python automatically takes the address of the object and assign it to a self variable to the methods present in the class.
That is the reason methods in class by default first variable is self.
Parameter values are taken from the second variable.
self.variable name is considered as instance variables.
These variables are given space in the object.
Instance variables are global to all the methods in the class.
Any method can access or modify the value.


In this class, we discuss the class variable in python.
The variable declared in the class called it a class variable.
The memory is allocated to class variables during the compilation time.
The variables that are declared as self are instance variables.
instance variables are local to an object.
Class variables are global to all the objects.
Any object can use or modify the class variables.

In this class, we discuss the method and constructor overloading in python.
In python, we don't have the concept of method overloading or constructor overloading.
First, we understand what is method overloading.
If two different methods have the same name we call those methods are overloading methods.
In python, if we write two methods with the same name. the method that is written last is considered.
Whenever we call the method. the method written last is called.
The same way constructor also.
