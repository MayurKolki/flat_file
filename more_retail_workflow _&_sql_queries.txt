## In this txt file I have mentions the steps which i have followed in IPYNB and sql. ##

1) studied the Business output requirements from given excel file which contained 4 sheets.
2)did brain storming to the given problem.
2) first I worked in jupyter notebook which is attached in the mail named as "MORE_RETAIL_LIMITED.ipynb".
3) imported the required libraries.
4)imported the dataset. 
5)EDA- removed "," from the integer data types,
       converted the the data set into belonging datatypes,
       removed NULL values, from the dataset,
       sorted the data according to date,
6)added new column "fillrate" such as the mathematical operation  (rcvval/orderval)
7)Saved this cleaned dataset and exported to so that we can use for sql.
8) observed the count of categorical data.
9) did group by on particular categorical data, 
   and no the levels of each categorical data.
10)count plot charts.
11) distribution charts.
12) group by on format and division.

due to time churn didn't able to do further task.

#base_data -> Is the name of table which we made from the jupyter notebook
#attached the base_data excel file in the email.
